I don't like new beginnings, they kind of suck. Just new things, new mindset, new environment, but my old habits are still there. For a while, I didn't even dream a whole lot. It was just emotions and events happening and time just slips and now I still feel like I'm 17 waiting for something, even if I'm working towards my "goals". 
Anyway, Luna Li is probably one of my favorite up-an-coming artist. I've always loved this soft pop-rock genre that's always been too underground for me to discover. I also think this niche genre is dominated by boy bands with lead singers that can't sing. So to me, it's a rarity for something this good mesh this well. A real treat. I actually have a playlist that has this song as it's start because to me, this song represents the start of something great, even if the skies aren't as blue and the sun isn't as yellow as you'd like.
